**How computers work?** 
Computers are everywhere now.
we use them everywhere
in our cars, offices, even on us (watches, telephones)
## what makes a computer , a computer 
A computer has three activities; enter, process, record and exit.
in fact what emerges is the result of the information given to it.
this is possible thanks to two components; software and hardwares.
The hardwares are cuicuits, plugs speakers .... that you can see inside the machine
Software is against running programs in the machine.
It is possible to install multiple or remove them.
These are games, browsers and applications.
It should be noted that hardwares can run more programs simultaneously however this can cause a slowdown.
Moreover, you have to know that the machine is not intelligent, it only obeys precise commands.
